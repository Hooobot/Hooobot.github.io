<h2 id="javascript-initial-impressions">JavaScript: Initial Impressions</h2>

<p>JavaScript is the leading language in terms of Web Development and Web Applications. It is by far one of, if not the most common language that websites are built off of, and such is why I am glad to have been able to dabble in learning it. Prior to which, I have mainly spent time learning POSIX C programming. I have come to realize the many differences and benefits that JavaScript has to offer, in addition to its unique capabilities that differentiates it largely from other programming languages.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways--differences">Takeaways &amp; Differences</h2>

<p>Initially, I was surprised to see how “loose” the language restrictions are, as it requires much less specification than C, similar to many other languages, albeit a bit more specification than Python, all while maintaining great utility at no cost of flexibility.</p>

<p>JavaScript is unique in the sense that it allows for no requirement of specification for data types and first-class functions. Instead of specifying a char, int, or string, JavaScript allows for the use of “var” and “let” to initialize a data type to be used throughout the code. In comparison to C, it allows for somewhat of a flexibility and as a side note, less pressure in athletic software engineering. Similarly, JavaScript establishes first-class functions that allow for functions to be tossed around similarly to a variable. This can allow for functions to be passed as an argument, stored within data structures, or even used in a return statement. All of which contributes to the overall flexibility of JavaScript and additionally increasing my personal efficiency when applying it to athletic software engineering.</p>

<h2 id="athletic-software-engineering">Athletic Software Engineering</h2>

<p>Athletic Software Engineering is a form of creating a code as a solution to a given problem. Especially as a student in the process of learning a new language, athletic software engineering is personally a great way for me to both learn and apply my knowledge in an interactive fashion, to create something functional that demonstrates my growth. Problems to demonstrate this include a Workout of the Day (WOD), to which I can apply my skill to solve a problem within a certain time. Due to the time constraints that come with each problem, the flexibility of JavaScript allows me to create, assess, and debug code quicker. Instead of worrying about pointers or changing every data type initialization, JavaScript allows for more manageability throughout solving WODs. While understanding the actual WOD itself and fitting the time limit can be stressful, it is definitely enjoyable once everything ends up properly functioning.</p>

<h2 id="conclusive-remarks">Conclusive Remarks</h2>

<p>Reflecting on JavaScript, it makes sense that it is used for many websites and web applications. While there exists competitors out there, the learning curve for creating web content with JavaScript can be much nicer than learning Rust or other languages. Having this language in my toolkit allows me to quickly create, and debut code in demands for time-sensitive problems.</p>
