## Software Engineering

Software engineering encompasses many principles of Computer Science but additionally expands out to have much more. While web development is a skill and concept that utilize software engineering, it does not fully define it. 

## What is Software Engineering

Software enegineering includes but is not limited to functional programming, collaboration with others, project management, design patterns, coding standards, and many more. In my experience, I was able to familiarize myself with the IntelliJ IDE and collaborated with others through GitHub. Through a project, we were able to create a functional web application catered to an audience of students and individuals of the hawaii.edu domain. Through particular formats, guidelines, and styling it was possible to form a design pattern which helps to better develop both website appeal and project clairvoyance between developer and audience.

## Application

While I was able to experience and create a solution for a dedicated audience, a lot of the skills I learned are things that I will be able to apply onwards from now. From the idea of splitting issues for agile project development or guidelines for better design and project direction, the fundamental skills that make up for software engineering are things that I know will come of value. Moreover, the tools used and practiced will almost definitely also come into play.
