  Eric Steven Raymond demonstrates the guidelines to what asking smart questions entails through his essay: “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way”. A smart question entails being precise and informative, clear and punctuated, and with detail and context without user bias. Following such should lead to better responses from those capable by allowing them to understand and assess the situation or goal to be achieved. Especially in terms of the software engineering scope of questions, there lies many uncertainties that may lead to a process from confusion to understanding, and ultimately learning. In a collaborative effort to resolve these, Stack Overflow is a forum site dedicated to posting questions open to the public and allowing the community to answer. Through this, it highlights the importance of asking good questions versus bad questions.

  An instance of a good question could simply be, [“How do JavaScript closures work?”
](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/111102/how-do-javascript-closures-work). 
The attached link details a user who posted this question asking for a better understanding of JavaScript closures. What made this question much smarter in accordance with the essay by Raymond was the background knowledge and efforts that the user knew of or tried. Given that the user has background on the concepts within the JavaScript closure and linking a detailed Schema that the user previously studied on, this allows the responder to shape their response and understand what the user is directly asking for without the need for catch-up or unnecessary prior knowledge. In the end, the user was able to receive numerous detailed responses in addition to responses including multiple examples and code snippets to better describe JavaScript closures.

  However, an example that deviates from “the smart way” of asking a question is also found commonly throughout many various media sources and also on Stack Overflow. In the following instance, the user does submit a snippet of the code, however does not properly address the goal, context, nor attempted solutions unlike the previous question. The question title was, [“there is bug in my working code.it does not work properly”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56835678/there-is-bug-in-my-working-code-it-does-not-work-properly). Initially, it was apparent that the prompted question lacked clarity in what it was asking. Moreover, the code that was submitted was not fully completed and was solely a snippet, making it even harder to contextualize what it is trying to accomplish. In response, this led to more questions to ask for the context rather than solutions to answer the given question. 

  Rather than focusing on the error and current issue when asking a question, there lies great significance in phrasing and providing context and clarity. By asking better questions, it prompts better responses and ultimately leads to an effective and efficient solution. Doing so also allows for quicker responses to problems and more detailed learning to prevent future issues of the similar concept.
