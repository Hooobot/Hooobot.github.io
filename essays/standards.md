  While some programmers are aware of proper coding etiquette, more than often many beginners have little to no clue. In fact, even some intermediate programmers may also be unaware. However, it is easily understandable given that each coding language may somewhat carry a unique style, and perhaps it's own Coding Standards. After having utilized ESLint with IntelliJ, it reformatted my perspective on the importance of Coding Standards. I believe that with proper coding standards it is possible to better debug, communicate solutions, and learn languagees.
  
# Why Have a Standard?
  
  When I started out, I had no concern of locations to comment code, whether or not to use a single line comment or a multi line comments, and I also did not pay too much attention to the indentation of functions and nested loops. Of course, this was quite early on to my venture of programming. Sooner or later I then realized that it was disgusting to look at and even worse to debug. In fact, when most of the time sink spent coding is done on debugging, wouldn't everyone agree that any solution to hasten that process can be idealized as valuable? Coding standards establish a good foundation to better examine, read, and develop code. In doing so, it solves numerous problems that many, if not all programmers would run into. By having neater code, it allows for better understanding of what is being created. No more getting lost in a function or within nested loops, instead it is way easier to determine what corresponds to what, or what each line does.
  
  Furthermore, by allowing code to be better understood by oneself, it similarly does the same affect with others. This allows easier understanding from programmers that may be collaborating on the same project, or perhaps programmers that could help in debugging code, or perhaps non-programmers who want to better understand the code. All of which reflects on the pillar of communication, which can be fundamental in creating solutions for customers. In achieving better coding standards, this inadvertently allows for better software engineering.
  
  Moreover, the use of coding standards can also be somewhat universal. In doing so, it allows for an easier understanding of the similarities between languages regarding syntax and possibly functions. By sharing similar concepts, it allows programmers to better bridge the gap between languages and ultimately have an easier time understanding any particular nuances that may set them apart from one another. Of course, this can help to define scripting versus object-oriented languages, or perhaps help understand how each can achieve similar tasks, or perhaps help to bridge the gap in what makes each more different than the other.
  
# Concluding Remarks
  
  Through the use of ESLint and IntelliJ, I was able to directly alter my coding style to fit that of ESLint and therefore have an easier time debugging any issues that I came across, which then improved my ability to increase in speed and efficiency. Of course, at first it was not something that I was used to, as I was used to my prior coding style, but after resolving the errors or suggestions that ESLint would prompt, it made me realize how I could turn my code into something much more efficient, or perhaps better shape my thinking to how I approach coding solutions. In doing so, I believe that coding standards have ultimately helped me grow as a programmer.
