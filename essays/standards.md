  While some programmers are aware of proper coding etiquette, more than often many beginners have little to no clue. In fact, even some intermediate programmers may also be unaware. However, it is easily understandable given that each coding language may somewhat carry a unique style, and perhaps it's own Coding Standards. After having utilized ESLint with IntelliJ, it reformatted my perspective on the importance of Coding Standards. I believe that with proper coding standards it is possible to better debug, communicate solutions, and learn languagees.
  
# Why Have a Standard?
  
  When I started out, I had no concern of locations to comment code, whether or not to use a single line comment or a multi line comments, and I also did not pay too much attention to the indentation of functions and nested loops. Of course, this was quite early on to my venture of programming. Sooner or later I then realized that it was disgusting to look at and even worse to debug. In fact, when most of the time sink spent coding is done on debugging, wouldn't everyone agree that any solution to hasten that process can be idealized as valuable? Coding standards establish a good foundation to better examine, read, and develop code. In doing so, it solves numerous problems that many, if not all programmers would run into. By having neater code, it allows for better understanding of what is being created. No more getting lost in a function or within nested loops, instead it is way easier to determine what corresponds to what, or what each line does.
  
  Furthermore, by allowing code to be better understood by oneself, it similarly does the same affect with others. This allows easier understanding from programmers that may be collaborating on the same project, or perhaps programmers that could help in debugging code, or perhaps non-programmers who want to better understand the code. All of which reflects on the pillar of communication, which can be fundamental in creating solutions for customers.
