<h2 id="making-a-webpage">Making a Webpage</h2>

<p>When first learning to make a webpage, it is common to do so solely with HTML and CSS. After all, raw HTML and CSS essentially is what makes a functional webpage. 
However, as CSS allows niche specifications, if a webpage is done solely with raw HTML and CSS, chances are making it look nice takes a whole lot of… CSS.
<br />
If only there was a way that allowed imports of prior CSS in a sense that allows for developers to import such file and create fancier webpages by using the styles of that import.<br />
Or should I say, UI Framework.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-framework">What is a Framework?</h2>

<p>Frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 allows for the use of implementable classes within HTML files that allow for easy imports of various CSS styles. 
Not only would it include padding or margins, it also contains containers, background colors, floats, and pretty much most of what you can do in CSS, except now with much less code. 
In terms of efficiency, this exponentially decreases the time it would take to create brand new CSS when there are class instances that allow the creator to make common style changes without the need for specific CSS code details. 
Taking it a step further, some implementations of frameworks would take much, much longer to do in raw CSS and is much more visibly appealing.
Moreover, there exists myriad UI Frameworks that allow for individualistic customization and features to any developer’s desire.</p>

<p>An example of which could be the website of Netflix which runs on the UI Framework of React.js: <br /></p>
<center>
<img class="rounded pe-4" src="../img/frameworkwheel/Netflix.jpg" style="text-align: center;" />
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="using-vs-learning">Using vs. Learning</h2>

<p>Throughout my use of Bootstrap 5, due to the framework being of a completely new nature for me, I realized there was a lot of information within it that I had to search through. However, the more I looked, the more I realized how much the framework contained. From icons to footers, there was a good deal of information to catch up with and fully utilize. Learning the features of it and being able to apply it makes it somewhat similar to learning another language.</p>

<p>I feel that with more practice and time, UI Frameworks allow for an extremely efficient and customizable webpage suited to how the developer may want to present any information or apply any interactive showcasing as desired.</p>

<p>Why spend hours on customizing a ton of CSS to make something that could be done easily with UI Frameworks?</p>
